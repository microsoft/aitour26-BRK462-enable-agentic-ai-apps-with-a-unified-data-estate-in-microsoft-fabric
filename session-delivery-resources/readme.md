## üöÄGet Started

### Review the Latest Deck and Trainer Notes

Always read all hidden slides under the ‚ÄúTrainer Section‚Äù before delivering the presentation. These slides contain critical context, updates, and delivery tips.

**The deck is updated regularly**. Check for the latest version before each delivery to ensure you have the most current content and demos.

### Understand the Session Flow

The session is designed for 45 minutes, split into three acts:

- Act One: Unified Data Platform (platform overview, demos, and integration points)
- Act Two: AI Powered Data Platform (Copilot, AI functions, and agentic experiences)
- Act Three: Closing and takeaways

Each act includes specific demos and talking points. Refer to the session flow table for timing.

This presentation is built around a single, relatable customer story: Zava. Zava is a beloved regional DIY retailer serving suburban communities, known for its commitment to both modernization and maintaining a trusted, local feel. The company‚Äôs journey is at the heart of every section in the session - from data challenges to AI-powered transformation - making the technical concepts accessible and relevant for any audience. 

Zava‚Äôs story highlights real-world pain points: fragmented systems, disconnected online and in-store experiences, and the growing demand for eco-friendly, transparent products. By following Zava‚Äôs path as they unify their data estate with Microsoft Fabric, adopt AI-driven solutions, and empower every team - from the CTO to the CFO and CISO - the presentation demonstrates how Fabric‚Äôs capabilities solve genuine business problems and drive innovation.

Speakers use Zava‚Äôs narrative to connect with participants, illustrate key features, and show the tangible impact of a unified data platform in action.

### üñ•Ô∏èDemos

All demos featured in this session are provided as recorded videos. This approach ensures a smooth and consistent experience for trainers and audiences, especially when demonstrating complex features or scenarios that require historical data, multi-step setups, or environments that may be difficult to replicate live. We expect speakers to use these recordings during their delivery, as they best showcase the intended outcomes and avoid technical issues that can arise in live demonstrations. 

However, to support hands-on learning and exploration, all demo content and supporting materials are available on GitHub for attendees. This allows participants to access the full environment, datasets, and scripts, so they can experiment, replay, and deepen their understanding at their own pace after the session. Trainers should encourage attendees to visit the GitHub repository for further practice and to explore the demos in detail.
